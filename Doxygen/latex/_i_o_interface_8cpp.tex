\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_i_o_interface}{IOInterface} class. \doxylink{class_i_o_interface}{IOInterface} will serve as an invoker in the command and the main class through which user can interact with the system. The entire system will be driven forward by the commands emitted by this class. It will also serve the roll of renderer for the entire system.
