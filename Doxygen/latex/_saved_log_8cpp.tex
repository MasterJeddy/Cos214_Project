\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the implementation of the \doxylink{class_saved_log}{Saved\+Log} class. \doxylink{class_saved_log}{Saved\+Log} serves as the memento in the memento design. It stores the same same vector of commands as the \doxylink{class_command_log}{Command\+Log} class. It can be save and loaded with the uses of the \doxylink{class_logs}{Logs} Class.
