\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the declaration of the \doxylink{class_command_log}{Command\+Log} class. \doxylink{class_command_log}{Command\+Log} will serve as an originator in the memento pattern. As the Event\+Poll emits commands this class will log them. This log can be used by the Event\+Poll to be rolled back to. In practise this will mean all commands in the log will have to be rerun by the system at a much faster rate the usual play.
